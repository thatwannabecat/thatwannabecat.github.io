    </ul>
    <p><h3>What Games are Allowed?</h3></p>
    <p>Any and all. Is it sold in a game store digital or otherwise? Good enough. Visual Novels, RPGS, Visual Novels, Shooters, Fighting Games, and more Visual Novels.</p>
    <p>Expect a lot of Visual Novels.</p>
    <p>The bottom line is that this list should contain a list of games that are fun to play and overall enjoyable. </p>
    <p>As a side note, several of these games delve into topics that require a Content Warning (CW) for those who have triggers. Best to check what is listed for the  Even without the CW they may cover mature topics that don't warrant a CW. Best to actually check out a game before you buy it to see if its something you are interested in.</p>
    <p>
        <h3>What kind of representation are we looking for?</h3>
    </p>
    <p> This should be used as a guideline for suggesting characters and is not an absolute checklist of what I/We am looking for. </p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Canon Trans</dt>
        <dd>Explicitly stated by Word of God or in game or so thoroughly implied to the point of confirmed. <strong>Although previously stated as a guideline, I don't want headcannons.</strong> Some level of canon or bust.</dd>
        <dt>Positive</dt>
        <dd>They are a positive representation of Trans people.</dd>
        <dt>Real Issues</dt>
        <dd>They deal with Trans or gender issues.</dd>
        <dt>Happy Endings/Live</dt>
        <dd>They aren't murdered/forced to go back to AGAB/etc. Tragedy porn is overrated.</dd>
        <dt>Taken Seriously</dt>
        <dd>Their Transness/Gender is not used for humor/humiliation.</dd>
        <dt>You Look up/Relate to them</dt>
        <dd>They on some level make you/others feel better or relate to them and your experiences of being trans. This is probably the most important one cause all others are just guidelines of ideas of whats good.</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>Again. <em>The important thing to note</em> is that this is just a starting point to get thinking of what makes good Representation. Representation doesn't just stop at being explicit, and is determined by stuff like <a href="https://medium.com/mammon-machine-zeal/against-representation-97bc44b4d609" title="An Interesting Essay on Representation">nuance, intent, and other aspects</a>. Good representation is important and there are <a href="http://citation.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/4/8/9/6/2/p489627_index.html" title="Symbolic Annihilation">studies</a> detailing the effects of the lack of it (also known as &quot;Symbolic Annihilation&quot; (yes this can be achieved simply by omission)). The character doesn't need to be absolute bestest thing ever, but some level of good is needed. Looking for perfection in anything just leads to toxicity.</p>
    <p><h3>Whats the Format??</h3></p>
    <p>Each entry will have the following format:</p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Name</dt>
        <dd><p>The name of the game. May eventually link to its own page.</p></dd>
        <dt>Systems</dt>
        <dd><p> A list of systems the game can be found on with links to their store pages.</p></dd>
        <dt>Genres</dt>
        <dd><p>The Genres the game falls under. Is it a RPG, a Visual Novel, a Shooter, or a Visual Novel? Is it fantastic in nature or grounded? This will give you a general scope of the game. </p></dd>
        <dt>
            Character Description
        </dt>
        <dd>
            <p>
                A very <em>brief</em> description of the character representation. This is not meant be a comprehensive description of the character, nor does it go into what I think of them quality wise (as a literary character, as representation). It does however detail role in the game, whom they represent and other details about them (is it discussed in game, or is more strong subtext, or is it word of god).
                <strong>If a character has a * next to them that means I'm considering them for removal.</strong> I probably haven't because of a variety of reasons. Most likely due to the fact that I don't fall under that characters
                vague umbrella and don't feel comfortable acting as a final arbiter for them.
            </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>
            Age Recommendation
        </dt>
        <dd>
            <p>
                A rough age recommendation. Many of these games don't have an ERSB rating due to their nature as indie games, but those that do I try to follow. Anything with 18+ is either explicit sexual content, or extremely violent in nature beyond normal M rating. Several of these games maybe entirely sexual in nature/pornographic or rely on a metric ton of blood and violence. Just a heads up.
            </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>
            Content Warning
        </dt>
        <dd>
            <p>
                This is a list of content warning or triggers or any disturbing content you may find in game (or just a photosensitive warning). Best to read this before checking any of these games out seriously to see if you can handle the content involved. Or just you know not play a game with suicide/transphobia/violence/shit you maybe tired of in real life. Life is hard and its ok just to have something fun.
