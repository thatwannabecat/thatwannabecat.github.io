    <p>
        Due to the fact that this is a github page there is an associated <a href="https://github.com/thatwannabecat/thatwannabecat.github.io">github repository</a> with this project.
        This will allow users to be able to submit changes on their own terms if they feel they have a game that meets the <a href="../guidelines/guidelines.html">guidelines</a> set.
    </p>

    <h3>Whats Required to Submit a Game?</h3>
    <p>A github account is all you need. There are two main methods to process a submission.</p>

    <h3>I don't know how to code!</h3>
    <p>
        That's ok! You don't need to know how to code to submit a game. Github has an <a href="https://github.com/thatwannabecat/thatwannabecat.github.io/issues">issue system</a>. All you need to do
        is use your git hub account to submit a new issue and give it the submission label. Provide as much info about the game and characters who are trans in it as possible. An example submission can be
        found <a href="https://github.com/thatwannabecat/thatwannabecat.github.io/issues/4">here</a> to give an idea of what is needed.
    </p>

    <h3>I do know how to code html!</h3>
    <p>
        Great! You can follow this <a href="https://codeburst.io/a-step-by-step-guide-to-making-your-first-github-contribution-5302260a2940?gi=3168854a6596">contribution guideline here</a> to get started.
        All you need to do is add the entry into the index html code as you would a normal table. When making your pull request its best that you provide further detail about the game, and characters in it.
        When the pull request is created a contributor (currently just me :/ (that_wannabe_cat)) will review the changes to the code and either mark it for approval and merge it, or request changes.
        If you have cloned the repository on your computer make sure to make pulls reguraly for updates.
    </p>

    <h3>What if I disagree with one of the games?</h3>
    <p>
        Contributors are humans too. So mistake will be made, more information about the game may be learned, or something that will push for a removal or rexamining of a character.
        If you want to get a discussion started yourself you can submit a removal issue following this example <a href="https://github.com/thatwannabecat/thatwannabecat.github.io/issues/5">here</a>. <strong>
            I don't want people making pull requests for removals as thats fairly darn easy to do and a simple issue and 5 minutes by a contributor can solve it.
        </strong>
    </p>

    <h3>Whats a Contributor?</h3>
    <p>
        Someone who as the power to approve or reject pull requests, and make direct changes to the code directly. Think of them
        like moderators on a server.
    </p>
    <h3>I Want to be a Contributor!</h3>
    <p>
        Err I haven't thought that far ahead yet. I've mostly just been doing this myself with a suggestion or two here and there.
        I do want other contributors in the future (ideally someone who knows how to do web design). Right now I'm hoping to get someone
        who doesn't fit under the same experiences as I do to help contribute and assess games. There is only so much input a sort of binary transfem
        white/latinx can bring. Its not the best that I make judgement calls on some transmasc/nonbinary characters.
