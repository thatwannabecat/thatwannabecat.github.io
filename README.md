## The Great Gender Games List ##

The code base for a list of all the good* video games with good* transgender/nonbinary representation. Because you deserve it.

*\*in the weird way that good is super subjective and subject to bias, human experience, and cannot be measured reasonably*


### About ###

One day I got fed up with all the mediocore lists for video games with LGBT+ rep particularly the lack of trans\*/nonbinary rep. After going on a kick of some games that had really *really* good trans rep (imo) I wanted to put a list together of all the good rep. Both as a means to share and for my own personal use.

I wanted some means of curation over the list, but wanted people to be able to submit stuff without me having to manual edit all the time. After learning about Git hub pages and that I wanted to host this on a website at somepoint this seemed obvious. 

Right now you are looking at the code base of the project, [here](https://thatwannabecat.github.io/) is the website itself.

### What is it Written in? ###

This is basically pure html with some java script to implement the [datatables](https://www.datatables.net/ "Datatables") framework. Also CSS.

### How do I use it? ###

Go to the website [here](https://thatwannabecat.github.io/) and start searching for games! You can use the search bar to search any aspect that you would like. Each game will have its name, a blurb about the characters in it, and some content warning stuff among other info. The website itself has more concrete info.

### How can I help? ###

If you got a game to contribute, or a bug to fix; make a pull request and start coding away! More info about contribution can be found [here](https://thatwannabecat.github.io/submission/submission.html).
