    <p><h3>What is this?</h3></p>
    <p>A list of Games with good (on the weird subjective level that is good) Trans/Nonbinary/Genderqueer/Assorted Gender Sounds inclusive. Yes they do exist. Probably may expand to other kinds of rep later down the line (namely other lgb+, plural rep if any decent exist). </p>
    <p><h3>Why exist? Aren't there others?</h3></p>
    <p>Yes, but most lists found are usually consider questionable for couple of reasons:</p>
    <dl>
        <dt>
            Lack of Comprehensiveness.
        </dt>
        <dd>
            <p>Indie games are growing by the number, and if you are queer they are probably the best bet for good rep until the world/mainstream media is a kinder more hospitable environment. This is not to dismiss characters like Crem in Dragon Age Inquisition, Vivian in Mario:TTYD, or Fl4k in Borderlands 3 for helping bring trans* characters into a more mainstream and positive light (they will be included). However at this focus of popular mainstream games ignores the work that may indie game creators, including many many trans/queer creators; are doing to make games more hospitable for trans people. There should be room for characters from indie games like Tara Bryck from Heart of the Woods, Min-seo from Butterfly Soup, Terra-Luna, Pluto, and Mercury from Heaven Will Be Mine; games like Monster Prom that select pronouns, and Damien from Dream Daddy (all of whom save Damien are not on Wikipedia's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_games_with_LGBT_characters" title="Wikipedia's List of LGBT Characters">list</a> of LGBT characters in video games). There should also be attention drawn to events that are for trans* games and trans* creators (such as <a href="https://itch.io/jam/trans-gal-jam-2"> trans-gal jam</a> (ignoring problematic issues with exluding anyone not AMAB/Transfem identifying)).</p>

            Questionable Quality.

            An important note on this: <em>good is by and large subjective</em>. Yes this is a contradiction to this point but what I want to have this list is some kind of community discussion/thought of whats good representation. What you may consider good, maybe different from the person who suggested this. 
            The goal of this rules is to have people put some thought into why this character or game is good representation. Not all representation is good representation.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_games_with_LGBT_characters" title="Wikipedia's list of LGBT characters">Wikipedia list of LGBT characters</a>
            is questionable in many places. Do you want to get recommended Catherine: Full Body after the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/major-spoilers-one-of-the-endings-in-catherine-full-body-gets-extremely-transphobic-moreso-than-that-original-op-updated-feb-17.100027/" title="This Transphobic mess again">mess
            of an ending (CW: Transphobia)</a> and treatment of Erica? Chrono Trigger is a classic, but is the only <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characters_of_Chrono_Trigger#Magus" title="Chrono Trigger Magus">Gender Queer character</a> being a minor villain the best rep? Do you want to play games that
            <a href="https://lgbtfansdeservebetter.com/bury-your-gays/" title="Bury Your Gays Website">bury your trans</a>? Probably not. Most picks by media outlets don't really put in effort to consider the quality of the character. Even fan/community lists often have questionable picks. Samus is transwomen is fun,
            but so far the only pointer is a very obscure interview with word of god using a slur on her. Is she the best pick for a list of trans characters? The goal is to include games where the obvious intent is to portray a trans character (the more explicitly trans the better) and provide some level of good treatment/representation for them.
            Villains will be included so long as they aren't a sterotype or are compelling (ideally both). </p>

            Lack of Detail.
        </dt>
        <dd>
            <p> Are you looking for some non-white queer characters finally? Can't seem to find any decent transmasc rep? Craving to use your neo-pronouns in a game? Want a game where all idea of gender is a joke? This list should help with that. </p>

           <p>
            More resources on good games to play, or good media to experience isn't a bad thing. There is more than likely a list out there that does
            all this list does and more, but having a second opinion on matters is always a plus.

            Because People Deserve to have Fun
        </dt>
        <dd>
            <p>I just want to have a list of fun games to play and to recommend to people that won't demonize them while playing it. One that is handled by a community of invested individuals can pool resources and give out good recommendations to people (or at least recommendations that people enjoyed on some level). Enjoying life is important, and we deserve to have games that represent us (and often made by people who are part of the queer community). A list that will hopefully be updated for some time, and provide a useful resource for those who want good representation.</p>
